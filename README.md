# Deep Learning for NLP
A series of Jupyter Notebooks describing Pytorch implementations of models solving a large set of NLP tasks


## Part I 

### I - 1 Word Embedding 

This notebook presents a Pytorch Word2Vec model, trainable following either a CBOW or a Skip-Gram objective, along with a demonstration of Gensim's Word2Vec and FastText models

### I - 2 Sentence Classification

This notebook presents a Sentence classification model, on top of pretrained custom, Gensim and FastText Word2Vec models.


### I - 3 Language Modeling

This notebook presents a Language Model on top of pretrained custom, Gensim and FastText Word2Vec models.
